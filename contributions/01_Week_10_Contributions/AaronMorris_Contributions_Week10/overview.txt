I worked a lot on the outer workings of the project this week.

I helped Jeffrey work his maze generation into the system,

and helped jessica bring her character into the game.
I helped with monster generation by building a fully reusable system that allows
the use of all unity animations, which is good leverage for the project.

I created a fully codable, nav-mesh-ready, global-illumination ready room block for the maze generation,
and I created an inspector panel with utility functions to complement Jeffrey's maze generation and let
generation happen at compile time when the maze can be baked with all the useful data that we need.

I created user interface elements that allow for pain to be displayed in combat, and published my working
experience using the UI to our group so that it can be used for more purposes.

I created a github repository to alleviate some of the trouble we have had lately, but it has not been
transitioned into full use yet.

The monsters are able to navigate through the generated mazes now, and the personality system is about 50%
completed.
