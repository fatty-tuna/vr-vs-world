Things worked on this week

- sound code
- wall sounds


- wall sounds will be broken up into smaller segments, which will then be randomised via code
- code pulls from an array of sounds, creating a more random variation and ensuring players don't get comfortable


- walking sounds will also be pulled from an array, ensuring the same pattern isn't likely to be played
