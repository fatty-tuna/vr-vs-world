# VR Vs. the World

> A guy with a vr headset fights for survival, pitted against his audience, using commands to make everything as horrifying and deadly as possible.

# This is our design studio project.

## We're looking to create social interactive media.

We want to create a social experience that puts a group of people together to have fun teaming up on a helpless guy plugged into a virtual reality headset.

We want to design an interface that allows viewers of a video stream to affect the world that the virtual reality guy tries to survive in.

We want to create an environment that the virtual reality guy will feel immersed in. We want their interactions with the environment to evoke emotion. And challenges, deaths, sounds, and the overall atmosphere should do the same.

We want people to work together to change how the situation develops, and have their plans manifest into hilarious interactions with the VR user.

## We have no idea how to get this done
