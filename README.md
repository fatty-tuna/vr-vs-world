# VR Vs. the World
> A guy with a vr headset fights for survival, pitted against his audience, who work together to make everything as horrifying and deadly as possible.

# This is our design studio project.
## We're looking to create social interactive media.

We want to create a social experience that puts a group of people together to have fun teaming up on a helpless guy plugged into a virtual reality headset.

We want to design an interface that allows viewers of a video stream to affect the world that the virtual reality guy tries to survive in.

We want to create an environment that the virtual reality guy will feel immersed in. We want their interactions with the environment to evoke emotion. And challenges, deaths, sounds, and the overall atmosphere should do the same.

We want people to work together to change how the situation develops, and have their plans manifest into hilarious interactions with the VR user.

## We have no idea how to get this done
### Tech
- Twitch Chat
- Oculus Rift
- Unity

### Process
> ...?

#### Management
We have team roles (Primary)[Secondary]
- art (Jessica) [Aaron, Taylor]
- programming (Aaron) [Jeffery]
- sound (Kio) [Jessica]
- management (Jeffrey) [Kio]
- interface (Taylor) [Jeffrey]

Management will direct the overall process, and each role leader will manage the progress in their section.

Each section's management process should be able to communicate:
- what has been done
- what is currently being worked on
- what is planned to be done soon

> How will we do this?

It would also be great to show off what the critical path is for each section, and for the project as a whole, so that everyone can work as efficiently as possible.

## We have a plan
> What was that again?

- Start with concept art
- Make some designs
- Make a prototype
- Figure out what's the funnest
- Adjust plan for fun times
- Get 'er done!

## What is the core process of the experience?

A player hooked up to VR and a video stream gets thrown into a world.
...

A group of people who are able to see the VR user live, and also some [...] view of the world, participate by somehow [...] having an impact on the environment.

The public users should interact with the simulation, with each other, and the VR user through extension for a social balance. By working together, social scalability.
