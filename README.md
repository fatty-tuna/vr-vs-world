# VR Vs. the World
> A guy with a vr headset fights for survival, pitted against his audience, who work together to make everything as horrifying and deadly as possible.

## Our Tech
- Twitch Chat (?)
- Oculus Rift
- Unity

## Our Process
- GitHub:
  - [System Architecture Docs](https://github.com/fatty-tuna/vr-vs-world/tree/master/architecture)
    - We use this to understand the way each part of the system works
  - [Update Journal Logs](https://github.com/fatty-tuna/vr-vs-world/tree/master/log.md)
    - We use this to follow each other's progress at a glance
    - We can work closely together and stay motivated

## Team Management
We have team roles (Primary)[Secondary]
- art (Jessica) [Aaron, Taylor]
- programming (Aaron) [Jeffery]
- sound (Kio) [Jessica]
- management (Jeffrey) [Kio]
- interface (Taylor) [Jeffrey]

We want an agile team, so we have primary and secondary roles where we want to help out, but we should be ready to do anything using the help of our docs, logs, and comments!

We use a scrum board with a product backlog. We've been having trouble getting it integrated into our workflow, but we're doing our best

## The Plan
### We have a plan
> What was that again?

- Work in parallel
- Get stuff done in a way where you can show off your concept and have others play with it as quickly as possible
- Manage your docs and logs
  - Unit tests would be sweet
  - Working on a dev branch and committing working modules would be nice
- Work together to build up the modules, and then bring them together
  - Could we use submodules in fatty-tuna?

## The Experience
